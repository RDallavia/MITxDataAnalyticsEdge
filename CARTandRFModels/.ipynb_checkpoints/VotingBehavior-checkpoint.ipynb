    "### The Study\n",
    "\"In August 2006 three researchers (Alan Gerber and Donald Green of Yale University, and Christopher Larimer of the University of Northern Iowa) carried out a large scale field experiment in Michigan, USA to test the hypothesis that one of the reasons people vote is social, or extrinsic, pressure.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "\"The researchers grouped about 344,000 voters into different groups randomly - about 191,000 voters were a \"control\" group, and the rest were categorized into one of four \"treatment\" groups. These five groups correspond to five binary variables in the dataset.\"\n",

    "### The Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"Civic Duty\" (variable civicduty)** group members were sent a note saying \"DO YOUR CIVIC DUTY - VOTE!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"Hawthorne Effect\" (variable hawthorne)** group members were sent a the \"Civic Duty\" message plus the message \"YOU ARE BEING STUDIED\" and told their voting behavior would be examined via public records.\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"Self\" (variable self)** group members were sent the \"Civic Duty\" message, in addition to recent voting records for everyone in their home. Furthermore, an updated message stated that updated voting records for the household would be sent after the election.\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"Neighbors\" (variable neighbors)** group members received the same message the \"Self\" group, accompanied not only by the household voting records, but also those of neighbors.  This was done to maximize social pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"Control\" (variable control)** group members received and represented the typical voter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional variables include **sex** (0 for male, 1 for female), **yob (year of birth)**, and **the dependent variable voting** (1 if they voted, 0 otherwise).\n",
